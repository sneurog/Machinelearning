# Machine Learning Assignments

This repository showcases a series of notebook assignments I completed as part of my machine learning course.

1. `Homework10_machine_learning.ipynb` - This notebook details a project where I implemented a simulated annealing algorithm.
2. `Machine_Learning_Homework9.ipynb` - This notebook features a project focused on developing a residual neural network.
3. `HW2_Gomez.ipynb` - This notebook includes a project on implementing a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network.
